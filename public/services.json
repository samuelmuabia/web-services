Sometimes I go back to my past orders in Amazon just to reflect on the time I put into researching and how happy I am with it. The only thing I notice is the battery life is only a few hours, so I probably wouldn't be productive if I was traveling, but I only use it at home so that doesn't affect me much.",

Its just perfect for light gaming, browsing, editing pictures and more.",
